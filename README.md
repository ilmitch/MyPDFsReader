# MyPDFsReader
Package to list and extract text from PDF files (btw my first contribution to GitHub :)
This simple package automatises the boring tasks of listing and extracting text from PDFs by means of PyPDF2.
Provided a directory path and file suffix pattern (default: *.pdf), the text of each listed pdf is stored in a key of a dictionary.
An example is provided in main.py
